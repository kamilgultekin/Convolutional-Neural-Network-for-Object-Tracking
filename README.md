# Convolutional Neural Network for Object Tracking
* **Author:** Turhan Can Kargın and Kamil Gültekin
* **Topic:** Vision-Based Control Course Project

The project we prepared for the **Vision-based Control** lecture, which is one of the Poznan University of Technology Automatic Control and Robotics graduate courses. In this project, a robot will be able to take an action by distinguishing different objects by using CNN.

## To-Do's
- [ ] Object tracking robotics applications will be investigated
- [ ] Detailed article research on CNN
- [ ] Analyzing ready projects
- [ ] Finding dataset
- [ ] Neural Network training
- [ ] Setting up a simulation environment
- [ ] Testing the algorithm on the robot
