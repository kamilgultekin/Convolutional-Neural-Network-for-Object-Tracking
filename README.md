## Image Processing
**Image processing** is a method that can be identified with different techniques in order to obtain useful information according to the relevant need through the images transferred to the digital media. The image processing method is used to process certain recorded images and modify existing images and graphics to alienate or improve them. For example, it is possible to see the quality declines when scanning photos or documents and transferring them to digital media. This is where the image processing method comes into play during the quality declines. We use image processing method to minimize the degraded image quality and visual distortions. Another example is the maps that we can access via Google Earth. Satellite images are enhanced by image processing techniques. In this way, people are presented with higher quality images. Image processing, which can be used in this and many other places, is among the rapidly developing technologies. It is also one of the main research areas of disciplines such as engineering and computer science [1].

Image processing is basically studied in three steps.

* Transferring the image with the necessary tools
* Analyzing the image and processing it in the desired direction
* Receiving the results of the data report and output that are analyzed and processed

In addition to the image processing steps, two types of methods are used for image processing. The first is analog image processing and the other is digital image processing. There are a number of basic steps that data must go through for digital and analog image processing. These steps are as follows:
* Preprocessing
* Development and viewing
* Information extraction

After these steps, results can be obtained from the relevant data according to the needs.

Image processing has purposes such as visualization, making partially visible objects visible, image enhancement, removing spots, noise removal, high resolution capture in the image, pattern, and shape recognition.


### Image Processing Techniques
Some techniques which are used in digital image processing include: 
* Anisotropic diffusion 
* Hidden Markov models 
* Image editing 
* Image restoration 
* Independent component analysis 
* Linear filtering 
* Neural networks 
* Partial differential equations 
* Pixelation 
* Point feature matching 
* Principal components analysis 
* Self-organizing maps 
* Wavelets

## Computer Vision

Human perception of the outside world is formed by perceiving and analyzing images, which is one of the most important perception channels, and interpreting them. All techniques aiming to create visual perception and understanding in humans on the computer fall into the field of computer vision and cognitive learning. Scientists working in the field of computer vision have played the biggest role in the advancement of artificial intelligence, which is the most mentioned deep learning sub-field today. 

Computer vision aims to make sense of all kinds of two-dimensional, three-dimensional or higher-dimensional visual digital data, especially with smart algorithms. In solving these problems, the field of computer vision uses the development and implementation of both mathematical and computational theory-based techniques such as geometry, linear algebra, probability and statistics theory, differential equations, graph theory, and in recent years, especially machine learning and deep learning. In addition to standard camera images, medical images, satellite images, and computer modeling of three-dimensional objects and scenes are of interest to computer vision.

Visual data detection and interpretation constitute the most important algorithm steps in many applications, from autonomous systems such as autonomous vehicles, robots, drones, to security and biometric verification areas. The outputs obtained are fed as inputs to the decision support systems in the next step, completing the artificial intelligence systems [2].
